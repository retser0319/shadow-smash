DESCRIPTION
===========
Based on my earliest stable font design (c. 1999 or 2000) I would draw these in Paint whenever I needed to label something. The capitals came first and it was allcaps for about 4 years until I started drawing lowercases in 2004. The name "Lionel" is my own middle name.

NOTE
====
This font displays best at 6pt.

A REQUEST FROM NATE547
======================
Once you install this font, find 2 ways to make the world, the country, your home state/province/county, or your hometown better than it is. Even if it's just recycling your newspaper instead of tossing it on the rubbish.
Since this font is special, you are REQUIRED to do these things or I will find you and hit you with a newspaper!! :D

Duty now for the future.
